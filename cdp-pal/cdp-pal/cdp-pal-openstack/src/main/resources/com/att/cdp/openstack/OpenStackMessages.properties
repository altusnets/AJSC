PAL_OS_FAILED_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION=PALOS0001E|\
  Unable to authenticate user [{0}] with provider for access to tenant [{1}]|\
  <p>Check the zone credentials and make sure that the correct \
    provider URL, tenant name, user id, and password are specified.  Verify the following:</p> \
    <ul> \
    <li>The client is attempting to access the correct provider.</li> \
    <li>Attempt to login manually to the provider using the credentials and the provider's \
    console or dashboard</li> \
    <li>Verify the settings in the zone credentials, if necessary, overtype the password with \
    a known good password.</li> \
    </ul> \
    <p>If the user authentication fails when a direct connection is attempted, then the provider \
    must be updated/configured to allow the user access, or the user credentials must be corrected, \
    or the client needs to use the correct provider (it could be the wrong provider).</p> |\
  CDP is attempting to connect to the OpenStack provider using \
    the zone credentials provided and the authentication failed.  CDP will attempt to connect to the \
    tenant identified in the zone credentials using the provider URL in the zone definition. The \
    user id and password provided in the zone credentials are used to authenticate the user to the \
    provider.  This message is nearly always a configuration issue wit hthe wrong userid or password, \
    or the wrong tenant name, or even the wrong provider URL.  Check these settings.

PAL_OS_NOT_AUTHORIZED=PALOS0002E|\
  Not authorized for access to service|\
  <p>CDP connects to the provider as the user specified in the client's zone \
    credentials.  The capabilities that the provider authenticates to CDP are those that are \
    granted to this user.  CDP needs to be able to create, query, modify, and delete the following \
    resources:</p>\
    <ul>\
    <li>Key-Pairs</li>\
    <li>Compute nodes (instances)</li>\
    <li>Volumes (block storage)</li>\
    <li>Networks</li>\
    <li>Subnets</li>\
    <li>Firewalls</li>\
    <li>Load balancers</li>\
    <li>Templates</li>\
    <li>Instances</li>\
    <li>Images (query and reference only)</li>\
    <li>Flavors (query and reference only)</li>\
    <li>Tenant Metadata (query only)</li>\
    <li>Instance Metadata</li>\
    </ul>\
    <p>Ensure that the user is granted these privileges, or use a different user for the tenant. \
    This will likely require coordination with the tenant support and administration team(s).</p>|\
  CDP is attempting to access some service of OpenStack and the provider has \
    failed the request because the user is not authorized.  The user that CDP uses to authenticate \
    to the provider, and which is being failed, is the userid defined in the zone credentials.
  
PAL_OS_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND=PALOS0003E|\
  Resource [{0}] with id [{1}] cannot be found on provider [{2}]|\
  No recovery needed.|\
  A request was made within CDP to access the provider and obtain a resource \
    of the indicated type and id on the provider, but the provider indicated that the resource does \
    not exist.

PAL_OS_INVALID_REQUEST=PALOS0004E|\
  Invalid request|\
  This is an internal error.  The CDP provider support abstractions generated \
    an incorrect API request.|\
  The request from CDP to the provider was not valid.
  
PAL_OS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=PALOS0005E|\
  Timeout waiting on request|\
  The provider may be experiencing slowness or outages that are preventing \
    CDP form accessing the provider.  This is almost always a provider issue, and may require \
    assistance from the provider support organization(s).|\
  CDP has generated a request to the provider for some services, but the \
    request did not complete within the time alotted.  The request is cancelled, and the operation(s) \
    being performed will fail.

PAL_OS_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTION=PALOS0006E|\
  Unexpected exception|\
  The provider is experiencing an outage or some internal failure \
    that caused the exception to be thrown back to CDP.  This is either an internal error in \
    the provider, or in rare cases it may be caused by CDP creating an incorrect request to \
    the provider API.  It is almost always a provider issue, but to verify, the api request \
    is logged to the CDP log and can be obtained.  Work this issue first as if it is a \
    provider issue.  IF it proves not to be, contact CDP development.|\
  CDP has made a request to OpenStack for some process or service and \
    has received an exception back from the provider.  The exception was not expected and there \
    is no context to understand how to recover from the exception automatically, so the request \
    is failed.

PAL_OS_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND=PALOS0007E|\
  Network [{0}] cannot be found on provider|\
  Correct the blueprint and specify the correct network resource, or create \
    the required network.|\
  CDP has requested access to the indicated network resource on the \
    provider but the resource does not exist.

PAL_OS_INVALID_SERVER_STATE=PALOS0008E|\
  Server [{0}], ID [{1}], is in state [{2}] but is expected to be in one of [{3}]|\
  <p>This can be caused by a mis-match between the image and template (flavor) \
    specified in the blueprint, or it may be caused by a provider outage.  Rule out the mis-match \
    first.  To do this, perform the following:</p>\
    <ol> \
    <li>Obtain the architecture, OS type, and size of the image requested.</li> \
    <li>Obtain the amount of ram, number of CPUs, boot disk size, and architecture of the requested \
    template (flavor)</li>\
    <li>Ensure that the boot disk size is greater than or equal to the image size</li> \
    <li>Ensure that the image architecture and template (flavor) architecture are the same</li> \
    <li>Ensure that the image operating system type is compatible with the template (flavor)</li> \
    <li>If there is an incompatibility, select a compatible image and/or template (flavor)</li> \
    </ol> \
    <p>If the image and template (flavor) are compatible, this is likely an internal outage \
    of the provider.  Refer to the provider support team for assistance.</p>|\
  CDP has performed some operation on a virtual machine on the OpenStack \
    provider, but the virtual machine is in an invalid state for CDP to proceed.  Alternately, CDP \
    needs to perform some operation on the virtual machine but has found it to be in an invalid \
    or unusable state.  The state CDP found it is in listed, as well as the list of states that are \
    acceptable.

PAL_OS_INVALID_DEVICE_NAME=PALOS0009E|\
  Device name [{0}] is invalid or conflicts with an already assigned device|\
  Change the device name in the blueprint.|\
  The virtual disk drive was specified to be attached to the instance \
    as the indicated device, but it was found that device conflicts with a device that already \
    exists, or the device is invalid. A conflict can occur because the image used to create the \
    virtual machine may attach additional ephemeral disks at device names that are unknown until \
    after the instance has been created.

PAL_OS_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION=PALOS0010E|\
  Extension [{0}] is not supported in provider [{1}]|\
  Install the required extension, or modify the blueprint to not \
    require that extension.|\
  CDP requires an OpenStack extension to be installed in order to \
    process the request, but the indicated extension is not available.

PAL_OS_RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE=PALOS0011E|\
  Resource or extension [{0}] is not available on provider [{1}]|\
  This is almost always a provider outage issue.  Contact the \
    provider support team for assistance.|\
  The specified OpenStack resource, or a required extension to the \
    resource, is not available on the provider.

PAL_OS_LOCATE_SERVICE_FAILED=PALOS0012E|\
  Attempt to locate service [{0}] failed|\
  Correct the provide configuration.  Contact the provider support \
    team for assistance.|\
  OpenStack is a collection of services, where each service implements \
    some part of the overall cloud infrastructure (such as the identity, network, compute, and other \
    services). In this case, the message indicates that a required service is not present or not \
    installed.  CDP cannot use this provider as is.

PAL_OS_SERVICE_CATALOG=PALOS0013I|\
  Service [{0}] type [{1}], [{2}] endpoints; public = [{3}], internal = [{4}], registered = [{5}]|\
  No recovery needed.|\
  This is an informational message that echoes the content of the OpenStack \
    service catalog as it is being processed by CDP.  When OpenStack services are installed, they \
    register their existence in the OpenStack service catalog.  When CDP connects to an OpenStack \
    provider, it reads the service catalog to dynamically detect what services are installed, \
    their versions, and the public URL used to access these services.  This message is a diagnostic \
    message only, and is information about the service catalog processing that CDP is performing.

PAL_OS_PROVIDER_EXCEPTION=PALOS0014E|\
  Exception {0} (with status code {1} = {2}) while processing service request {3}. \
    Original exception message was:\n \
    {4} \n \
    Service request state context:\n \
    {5}|\
  This may be caused by an internal state or outage issue in the \
    provider, or it may be caused by incorrect api requests from CDP.  Refer to CDP development \
    for diagnosis.|\
  CDP was interacting with OpenStack and was using an OpenStack API when \
    an exception was thrown back to CDP.  The detailed information about the exception and the \
    processing being performed within CDP is shown in this message.
        
PAL_OS_REGION_REQUIRED=PALOS0015E|\
  No region specified but multiple endpoints were found for service {0} at {1}, \
    please specify a region to select the correct endpoint(s)|\
  The provider API is exposing one or more regions, but the zone in \
    CDP does not specify which region to use.  A region must be specified in the CDP zone \
    that matches a region exposed by the provider. Update the CDP zone definition to specify \
    the desired region.|\
  CDP has connected to the OpenStack provider and found that the service \
    catalog specifies endpoints for services in multiple regions, but the connection information \
    provided does not specify a region.  This is an ambiguous situation and CDP will fail the \
    request to connect to this provider because the regions is not specified.
        
PAL_OS_REGION_NOT_FOUND=PALOS0016E|\
  Region {0} was specified but no endpoints for service {1} were found for this region!|\
  The CDP zone specifies a region, but no region with that name is \
    specified by the provider.  Correct the CDP zone definition to specify the correct \
    region name, or no region if the provider does not specify any.|\
  CDP is attempting to connect to an OpenStack provider and has found \
    that there are no services registered in the service catalog for the regions specified \
    in the connection parameters.

PAL_OS_SERVICE_CATALOG_FAILURE=PALOS0017E|\
  Failed to resolve versions for service {0} at url {1}, exception {2}, reason {3}|\
  This is almost always a provider configuration issue.  Contact \
    the provider support team for assistance.|\
  When CDP connects to OpenStack, it reads the service catalog \
    of that provider instance to determine no only what services are installed, but also the \
    versions installed.  CDP uses this information to dynamically load the correct support \
    for the installed version.  If CDP cannot obtain the version information for any service, \
    or if the service reports versions that CDP does not support, then this message is the \
    result.

PAL_OS_SERVICE_INSTALLED=PALOS0018I|\
  Service catalog discovery found "{0}" service for tenant "{1}" in region "{2}" at public URL "{3}"|\
  No recovery needed|\
  This is an informational message that lists each service located in \
    the OpenStack service catalog, the tenant that we are connecting to (OpenStack tenant), \
    the region (if any), and the public URL where the service will be contacted.

PAL_OS_SERVICE_OVERRIDE=PALOS0019I|\
  Service {0} URL was overridden with {1} by user properties|\
  No recovery needed|\
  This message indicates that the URL to connect to the specified \
    service was provided as part of the connection configuration properties and was NOT obtained \
    from the service catalog.  This indicates that the user has overridden one or more service \
    specifications and may be normal.  It will always be normal for the identity service, \
    since this service must be know to connect to the provider in the first place.  However, \
    it is an indication of possible configuration problems if the overridden URL's are not \
    correct.  The version of the service will still be checked but at the URL provided.  The \
    service catalog will not be consulted for this service. 

PAL_OS_SERVICE_VERSION_SUPPORTED=PALOS0020I|\
  Service {0} version {1} is supported and will be loaded if referenced|\
  No recovery needed|\
  CDP has found that the service installed at \
    the indicated provider supports a version of the API that CDP also supports.  CDP attempts \
    to bind to the highest version of the supported APIs for all services, and only steps \
    down when there are conflicts.  The negotiation has completed, and this message indicates \
    the version of the service API that CDP is supporting.  The support is loaded on demand, \
    so if no actions in CDP reference this service, it will not be used.  The first use \
    of the service will load the API support.

PAL_OS_API_VERSION_DETECTION_FAILED=PALOS0021E|\
  {0} service api version detection using url {1} generated an invalid, \
    unrecognized, or empty response, reverting to default version support for this service.|\
  This is likely a configuration issue with the provider, \
    OR it may be an incompatibility between the provider and CDP.  Contact CDP development \
    for assistance.|\
  The negotiation of API version binding has failed for the \
    indicated service.  In order to continue, CDP will bind a fail-safe version of the API \
    support that should work for the most basic requests to this service.
    
PAL_OS_CONNECTION_FAILED=PALOS0022E|\
  Connection to provider {0} service {1} at {2} failed, called from {3}:{4}.{5} on thread {6}|\
  The PAL library was attempting to connect to the indicated provider's service (at the \
    indicated URL), but the connection failed for some reason.  The underlying cause of \
    the failure is likely an OpenStackConnectException, which will also be formatted and \
    will provide additional information.  The class, method, and line number of where the \
    request was made in the PAL library source code is also provided to assist in \
    analysis and debugging.|\
  Correct the cause of the failure and rerun.  
  
PAL_OS_REQUEST_FAILURE=PALOS0023E|\
  An error was returned from the provider attempting to {0}|\
  The provider failed the request for some reason.  The failure will also include an OpenStack \
    Response Exception, which will also be formatted. The response exception from OpenStack \
    will contain more information as to why OpenStack failed the request.|\
  Correct the cause of the failure and rerun, if applicable. 
  
PAL_OS_RETRY_OPENSTACK_CONNECTION=PALOS0024E|\
  Attempt to connect to {0} failed with {1} ({2}), attempt {3} of {4}, waiting {5} seconds|\
  The provider failed to connect to the indicated URL with the indicated exception (and message). \
    This is the indicated attempt to connect, with the defined limit of retry attempts also \
    being displayed in the message.  The system will wait a specified amount of time (in seconds)\
    before retrying the connection.  If the connection is successful, the system proceeds to \
    process the request.  If the connection cannot be established within the specified retry limit\
    then the request is failed.|\
  Correct the cause of the failure to connect.  The retry delay and limit properties can be \
    configured for each context, and they can be different from one context to another if needed. \
    See the "ContextFactory" class, properties "PROPERTY_RETRY_DELAY" and "PROPERTY_RETRY_LIMIT" \
    for details on configuring these values.  If not specified, they default to no delay (0) and \
    a retry limit count of 1 (once only).    

PAL_OS_VERSION_OVERRIDE_FAILED=PALOS0025E|\
  Service {0} version {1} is not supported and the appropriate version will be detected and loaded|\
  The version provider by the user for the service could not be loaded as it is not the supported version.|\
  Correct the cause of the failure and rerun, if applicable.
