INVALID_POLL_INTERVAL=PAL0033E|\
 The polling time interval specified ({0}) is not valid.|\
 Correct the interval to a valid value|\
 Polling of the provider must be done in real, positive, non-zero time intervals, usually specified in seconds. \
   The interval specified is either negative or zero and does not represent a valid interval. 
   
INVALID_POLL_TIMEOUT=PAL0034E|\
 The poll timeout value ({0}) must be greater than or equal to the poll interval ({1})|\
 Correct either the poll interval or the timeout, or both, as needed|\
 The timeout to polling must allow for at least one complete poll interval. Therefore, the timeout must be \
   at least as long or the same as the polling interval.
   
INVALID_INTEGER_ARGUMENT=PAL0035E|\
  The argument "{0}" is not a valid integer, the value is "{1}". |\
  Correct the argument to specify a valid integer|\
  The call to the method specified a value that was expected to be a valid integer value, but the value provided \
    is not an integer representation.
   
NOT_NAVIGABLE=PAL0036E|\
  Object is not connected to a context or the method is not implemented, no model navigation is possible!|\
  Correct the application to navigate using a connected object|\
  A request to navigate a data object cannot be performed because the data object is not connected to an open \
    usable context.    
    
SERVER_TIMEOUT=PAL0037E|\
  The state of server "{0}" with id "{1}" did not change to an expected state within the provided timeout \
    ({2} seconds).  The last state of the server is "{3}", and the expected state(s) are "{4}".|\
  Correct the state of the server in the provider and re-run the operation if needed|\
  An operation was requested on the indicated server but the operation either did not complete in the alloted \
    time, or the server entered a final state that was not one of the expected states.  
    
RETRY_PROVIDER_CONNECTION=PAL0038E|\
  Attempt to connect to {0} failed with {1} ({2}), attempt {3} of {4}, waiting {5} seconds|\
  The provider failed to connect to the indicated URL or service name with the indicated \
    exception (and message). This is the indicated attempt to connect, with the defined limit \
    of retry attempts also being displayed in the message.  The system will wait a specified \
    amount of time (in seconds) before retrying the connection.  If the connection is successful, \
    the system proceeds to process the request.  If the connection cannot be established within \
    the specified retry limit then the request is failed.|\
  Correct the cause of the failure to connect.  The retry delay and limit properties can be \
    configured for each context, and they can be different from one context to another if needed. \
    See the "ContextFactory" class, properties "PROPERTY_RETRY_DELAY" and "PROPERTY_RETRY_LIMIT" \
    for details on configuring these values.  If not specified, they default to no delay (0) and \
    a retry limit count of 1 (once only).    

IMAGE_TIMEOUT=PAL0039E|\
  The state of image "{0}" with id "{1}" did not change to an expected state within the provided timeout \
    ({2} seconds).  The last state of the image is "{3}", and the expected state(s) are "{4}".|\
  Correct the state of the image in the provider and re-run the operation if needed|\
  An operation was requested on the indicated image but the operation either did not complete in the alloted \
    time, or the image entered a final state that was not one of the expected states.  
    
PRINCIPAL_HAS_BEEN_AUTHENTICATED=PAL0040I|\
  Principal [{0}] has been authenticated on provider [{1}] to tenant [{2}]|\
  The user (principal) has been authenticated and a connection exists to the provider type \
    indicated, and connected to the specified tenant|\
  This is an informational message that indicates normal connection processing has completed and \
    the user has successfully logged in to the provider.  No recovery action is needed or \
    warranted.  
    
 UNIMPLEMENTED_OPERATION=PAL0040E|\
  Operation [{0}] is not implemented in provider [{1}]|\
  The specified operation is not implemented by the current provider. The Operation may be implemented \
  depending on the provider, but is not currently available in PAL.| \
  If you require this operation to be implemented, please contact a CDP Representative.
