  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>This package contains all of the exceptions that are defined as part of the rime API. Since rime is intended to
    be a universal, abstract mechanism to access any cloud infrastructure, the actual exceptions of the underlying cloud
    implementation must be translated to common, well-defined exceptions that are defined by rime. This means that any
    client that accesses a cloud infrastructure implementation using rime does so using rime's definitions of data
    types, services, and exceptions. This ensures that the behavior is always the same as seen by the client regardless
    of the underlying implementation.</p>
  <p>
    All rime exceptions descend from a common base class, named
    <code>
      <strong>RimeException</strong>
    </code>
    . This class is a checked exception. Where possible, and practical, the rime api services always throw one of these
    defined rime exceptions. In some cases, especially with argument errors or state of the api exceptions (trying to
    use it when it is in an invalid condition) the rime api services will use standard java defined exceptions (such as
    IllegalStateException or IllegalArgumentException).
