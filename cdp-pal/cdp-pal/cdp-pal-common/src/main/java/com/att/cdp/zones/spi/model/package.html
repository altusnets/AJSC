  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    This package contains all of the classes that implement the <em>Connected</em> version of the model classes.
    Connected objects are objects that were created from the context and are associated with an open, usable context to
    a service provider. They provide implementations of navigation of the abstract data model and allow the client to
    interact with the service provider through the model.
