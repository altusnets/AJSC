  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>This package contains all of the model objects that are defined as part of the rime API. Since rime is intended
    to be a universal, abstract mechanism to access any cloud infrastructure, the actual data objects of the underlying
    cloud implementation must be translated to a common, well-defined model that is defined by rime. This means that any
    client that accesses a cloud infrastructure implementation using rime does so using rime's definitions of data
    types. This ensures that the behavior is always the same as seen by the client regardless of the underlying
    implementation.</p>
